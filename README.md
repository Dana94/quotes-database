# Quotes Database

> A remake of an [old quotes project](https://github.com/Dana94/random-quote-machine).

You can share the quotes on Twitter and filter by author and tags.

I'm still be adding new quotes and tags after this project is finished.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Notes

### See a mistake in the quotes?
- The quotes are located [here](https://github.com/Dana94/serverless-graphql-netlify-starter), if you want to fix anything make a pull request and I'll try to check it out when I can. :+1:
